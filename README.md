# Educational Newton's Cradle Simulation

This is a web application modelling Newton's Cradle. It allows the user to modify parameters such as the coefficient of 
restitution and uses those values to simulate the path of each ball. 

Created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript in August 2021 during a co-op term.
